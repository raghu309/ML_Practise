Synopsis: The film unfolds in two distinct acts, each offering a unique experience. However, its notable consistency becomes a stumbling block, potentially limiting the dynamism sought by viewers. Described as "very okaish," the overall product reflects a prevailing sense of mediocrity that permeates the narrative. First Half: The initial half maintains a moderate pace until approximately 15 minutes before the intermission. Subsequently, the narrative experiences an upswing, albeit with a hint of hastiness. The abrupt demise of a pivotal character leaves little room for the audience to empathize. Comedic elements mostly miss the mark, save for a solitary scene. Clearly defined stakes fall short in justifying subsequent character actions, hindered by a screenplay marked with half-baked plots. Second Half: Surpasses the first, with comedic lines landing effectively. However, the persistent screenplay issues persist. The film reaches its pinnacle in the final 15 minutes. Editing presents a challenge, particularly in emotional scenes with abrupt cuts that should have been extended for a more profound impact. Musical Integration: The music, particularly in the second half, stands out as a strong suit, unmistakably signaling the distinctive touch of a Hirani film. It greatly enhances the cinematic experience, seamlessly blending with the storyline. However, there is a point where it becomes unexpectedly out of place, almost jarring, momentarily disrupting the narrative flow. Despite this hiccup, it doesn't overshadow the overall brilliance of the film's musical composition. Final Verdict: Dunki, though a commendable effort, falls short of realizing the full potential of its talented cast, especially Vicky Kaushal, who has acted brilliantly, and the renowned Raj Kumar Hirani. While not his magnum opus, the film is deemed good without leaving a lasting impression. Despite some shortcomings, Dunki manages to showcase the undeniable talent of its creators and cast.

I am a massive Hirani fan. Had huge expectations with this one. Expected there to be a lot more good moments than the trailers just like all Hirani films. But am pretty disappointed. The 1st half starts off pretty good, nearing the interval, the setup wasn't too bad. Despite the basic plot, was still engaging till then. Then follows the nosedive in the 2nd half. The script & screenplay is not that bad. Even the dialogues are okayish. But the execution falls flat. Never has someone looked so out of place than Srk in this film. This will be remembered as a casting blunder in Hirani filmography. Srk anyways, post the early 2000s, has completely lost his whatever average acting mojo he had in him. His successful films this year, didn't even require Hirani style acting anyways. But this one had a different requirement. And clearly, that was not met.

Dunki is a unique take on a situation not known by many in India. In a way, it educates people to some extent. Bur since the problem is not known by many, audiences may not be able to relate to the story. The story revolves around a group of people who want visit/migrate to UK for different reasons. Their journey, called, dunki, based in the route they take is full of emotions and a roller coaster ride. The common reaso in migrating to UK for the characters is the need to earn a good livelihood. In today's scenario,many may feel thar there are ample opportunities here and may not think the story to be good. However, everyone will surely relate to the emotions and when it comes to emotions, no one can beat SRK. That man speaks emotions with his eyes, nose, ear, hair, literally everything. He is so popular for a reason. SRK shines all along in the movie. But the person who steals the show is, Vicky Kaushal. He is at par with SRK in the screen time he gets, very impactful acting. He has been doing amazing acting and for me, he takes the crown of the best actor in this movie. Tapsee has always been amazing, and her role in this movie gives her ample moments to prove her mettle. Rest of the actors are doing justice to their roles and are a treat to watch.
